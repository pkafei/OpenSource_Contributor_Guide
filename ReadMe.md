# Guide to Contributing to Open Source

### What is open source software?

Open Source software is a programming project that is maintained by the community. The code, design, and documentation can be freely accessed by the curious.

### What does it mean to contribute to open source software?

Open source software is mostly maintained by volunteers. These people dedicate their time to ensure the code we're using is robust and up-to-date.

### Why should I contribute to open source?
Trying to break into tech but don't know how? Writing documentation, designing, and programming will give you real-world experience in a working on a technical project.

 
### How can I contribute? I'm not a ninja coder.

Contributing to open source is another way of volunteering. Think about it- if you had a soup kitchen would you only accept chefs as volunteers? Of course not. It takes a team of different skilled professionals to make a project successful. Open source projects are in dire need of quality documentation, and intuitive graphic design.
